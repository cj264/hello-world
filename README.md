My first time using GitHub. There is a lot to learn here. I'm new to programming and i hope this will help provide me with a clear path on this journey
My name is Chukwuemeka and I'm a recent graduate of Mechanical and Offshore Engineering for Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen.
Life as we know it is a string of choices that lead to consequences.
